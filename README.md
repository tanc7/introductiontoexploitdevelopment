# introductiontoexploitdevelopment: PwnBoxes

For my Udemy Course "Introduction to Exploit/Zero-Day Discovery and Development". 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

Utilizes Docker's platform and architecture emulation feature to pull packages, compile them locally, and have...

1. Guaranteed exploitable binaries under specific kernel versions
2. Safely exploit and root boxes from the host
3. Package all required tools within the package (gdb, peda, gef, Python3, pwntools, gcc, ldd etc.) without need to install anything on the host except Docker.io
